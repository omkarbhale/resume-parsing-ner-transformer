EXPERIENCE

Air Liquide Global Engineering and Construction Solutions 2015-2020
Fortune 500 company. Industry leader for design and engineering of leading-edge gas processing facilities.

Syngas and Methanol Process Engineer (Frankfurt, Germany, March 2019-July 2020)

e Leveraged experiences in “Air Separation” to bring new perspectives to a “Syngas &Methanol” Malaysian project
(Capex $110M); accelerated its instrumentation design by completing the task 1 month ahead of schedule.

e Mentored 2 international colleagues by organizing internal process training sessions; coordinated work from S
different process units among 3 engineers; received recognitions from all process leads.

e Created a streamlined tool for team by developing macros to combine 1000+ datasheets automatically, cutting
back delivery time from 5 days to 2 days to meet client’s requests.

e Managed 1 engineer and researched together on performance of 2 process tools to improve prediction accuracy
of equipment sizing and optimize design efficiency; released new versions of both tools.

Air Separation Process Engineer (Paris, France, July 2017-February 2019)

¢  Collaborated through a highly challenging revamping project in Poland cross-functionally (Capex $11M) to deliver
reliable basic designs for 20+ equipment, achieving zero “non-conformance” in engineering and construction.

e Led and closed clarifications with 15+ international suppliers for key equipment and urged for technical
compliance; expanded responsibilities to detail design and assisted in deal negotiation to help bring project meet
schedule; established credibility among a French male-dominated team.

e Conducted root cause analysis for energy inefficiency across 2 oxygen compressors; guided team to take on the
most optimized machines, saving client 400kW power and $3.5M annual operation costs.

e Initiated safety check for plant’s initial 70s design; identified 8 unforeseen safety devices in risks by integrating
on-site resources and performing systematic analysis; drove project team to upgrade these 8 devices to foster
safety and strengthen partnership with client.

Air Separation Process Engineer (Hangzhou, China, April 2015-June 2017)

¢ Developed the smallest modular plant “Sigma+110” (Capex $3M) despite design constrains; piloted design
review; maximized product diversity by developing14 operation runs to exceed product team’s expectation.

e¢ Built and compared across different process models to economize design cost, sparing 2 equipment ($120K) from
specific processes; presented results during process forum to improve design competitiveness.

e  Volunteered to join an onsite task force in Inner Mongolia; facilitated experts to troubleshoot plant’s
underperformance and generated reports, helping clients cut losses and recover plant’s production.

e Hosted a 500+ people’s party and gave a 20 minutes public speaking for 400+ students in recruiting event.

ADDITIONAL

e Obtained 1 certification for product management and 3 certification for Python programming.
e Yoga — persisted in practicing various types of yoga 3 times per week for more than 1 year.
e =©Art & design — devoted to impressionism, cubism and sculptures; fascinated in art museums and exhibitions.
